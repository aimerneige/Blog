# Daily English On BBC Learning English

[2020-06-15] [**Whisper vs Murmur vs Mumble**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/eiam/unit-2/session-24)

I’m Georgina from BBC Learning English.

Do you ever wonder about the differences between **whisper**, **murmur**, and **mumble**?

They are all use to describe different ways of speaking quietly.

**Whisper** means to speak quietly, often on purpose, so that only someone very close can hear what you are saying!

- **I don’t want everyone to hear! I’ll have to whisper.**

- **I’ve got a secret to tell you. I’ll have to whisper it though.**

**Murmur** means to speak quietly, often in a low continuous voice, so it’s hard to understand.

- **‘I love you’ she murmured in her sleep!**

- I can’t hear what you are saying, stop **murmuring**!

**Mumble** means to speak quietly, often in a low voice, making it difficult to understand.

- **She’s always mumbling and complaining very quietly so I can’t hear! It drives me mad!**

- That was a really **mumbled** apology. I could hardly hear it!

Bye!
